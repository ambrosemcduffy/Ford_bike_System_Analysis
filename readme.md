## Dataset

> The dataset I've chosen was the ford Gobike System Dataset. Before I could do any analysis I needed to make sure there wasn't any nan values, missing values, duplicates, and uncompatible data-types. I downloaded the data programatically, so it can be used by anyone wanting to test out my work. I did a clean up step before any exploration.

Some of the Data in the dataset had negative values in the duration time. If the time is starting off at Zero this is for sure an error. 
Another problem I ran into was the were outliers in the duration data I had to clean this up before I can see anything worth looking at. 

## Summary of Findings

> My findings into user behavior was a bit interesting I found that casual users tend to ride longer than users with a membership on average by 13 minutes. Which I'm guessing most people do not want to be locked into a membership, but likes the product overall.

Also, I found that most users prefered the docked ride type other than electric ride type, and this did not very at all.
Nevertheless, when it came to which street is the most popular for users I would say 10th street.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Does location influence ride duration?, and does does location influence if casual customers want to use the product or not.
