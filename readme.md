## Dataset

> The dataset I've chosen was the ford Gobike System Dataset. Before I could do any analysis I needed to make sure there wasn't any nan values, missing values, duplicates, and uncompatible data-types. I downloaded the data programatically, so it can be used by anyone wanting to test out my work. I did a clean up step before any exploration.

Some of the Data in the dataset had negative values in the duration time. If the time is starting off at Zero this is for sure an error. 
Another problem I ran into was the were outliers in the duration data I had to clean this up before I can see anything worth looking at. 

## Summary of Findings

> My findings into user behavior was a bit interesting I found that casual users tend to ride longer than users with a membership on average by 13 minutes. Which I'm guessing most people do not want to be locked into a membership, but likes the product overall.

Also, I found that most users prefered the docked ride type other than electric ride type, and this did not very at all.
Nevertheless, when it came to which street is the most popular for users I would say 10th street.

For casual users it was 10th and Empire st, and for users with memberships it was 10th st at University. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Does location influence ride duration?, and does does location influence if casual customers want to use the product or not?
I think so it seems when it comes to ride duration weekends specifically Saturdays get the most hits for rides.

When it comes to users sticking with the casual users is key, because they may not want to be locked down by a membership but they are frequent users. 
In fact some casual users ride more than 40 minutes this is an outlier not really seen in membership groups.

I also find out the majority of ride duration are relatively short around 5-10 minutes.
